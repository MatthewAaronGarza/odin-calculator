# odin-calculator

we're making a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

Update 1:
The layout for the calculator is complete. We not need to add functionality to the divs that are acting like buttons.

Goal for next time: add functionality to the add, subtract, clear buttons.

Known bugs 
- digits overflow off the display div when length of the number is very large
