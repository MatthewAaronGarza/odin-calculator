# odin-calculator

we're making a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

Update 1:
The layout for the calculator is complete. We not need to add functionality to the divs that are acting like buttons.

Goal for next time: add functionality to the add, subtract, clear buttons.

Known bugs: 
- digits overflow off the display div when length of the number is very large

Things to look out for:
- what happens if the user enters: "1 + +" ?
- what happens if the user enters: "+ 5 +" ?
- what happens if the user enters: "5 + 5 +" ?
    - this seems like we should add functionality so that the calculator starts addign the 5s for the user
