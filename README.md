# odin-calculator

we're making a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

Update 1:
The layout for the calculator is complete. We not need to add functionality to the divs that are acting like buttons.

Goal for starting again - Add functionality to the add, subtract, multiply, and divide buttons. Have the numbers appear in the display.
