# odin-calculator

we're made a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!




Todo list ‚≠ê 


Known bugs: 
- digits overflow off the display div when length of the number is very large

Things to look out for:
- what happens if the user enters: "1 + +" ?
- what happens if the user enters: "+ 5 +" ?
- what happens if the user enters: "5 + 5 +" ?
    - this seems like we should add functionality so that the calculator starts addign the 5s for the user
